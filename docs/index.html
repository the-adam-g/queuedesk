        <h1><special>Simple</special> Ticket Creation</h1>

    <section id="messages">
        <h1>Customer Accounts Are <special>Not Required</special></h1>
        <p>Upon ticket creation, users are presented a URL with their <special>UAC</special> (Unique Access Code) integrated into the link. Upon going to the link, users will be prompted to enter their <special>email</special> used in their ticket to access their ticket details to prevent hackers and any data leaks. Queue<special>Desk</special> also makes use of the <a href="https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs/tree/master">QRCode.js library</a> created by <a href="https://github.com/davidshimjs">davidshimjs</a> but similar to chart.js uses a local copy of the JavaScript code to ensure no external API reliance.</p>

        <h1><special>UAC</special> - Unique Access Token</h1>
        <p>Each ticket is protected by a cryptographically secure <special>UAC</special> generated using the PHP function <code>random_bytes()</code> which is a PRNG (Pseudorandom number generator) that generates a 16 byte random code unique to each user allowing them to access their ticket details. QueueDesk ensures that no open ticket will have the same UAC.</p>

    <section id="messages">
        <h1>Email-Based <special>Verification</special></h1>
        <p>Upon attempting to view their ticket details using their<special> UAC</special>, ownership is verified server-side by matching the submitted <special>email</special> against stored ticket data.</p>
